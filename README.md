# Pygame Helper
An in-development library to help build 2D games in Pygame, currently includes:
 *  Tilesets

## Setup
### 1. Clone Repo
`git clone https://github.com/BSmith156/Pygame-Helper.git`
### 2. Prepare Library
Copy the `pygame-helper` folder into your Pygame project's folder

## Usage
### Tileset Manager
Manages tilesets created by the Tileset Creator tool
#### 1. Import TilesetManager
`from pygame_helper.tileset_manager import TilesetManager`
#### 2. Create a TilesetManager Object
`tileset_manager = TilesetManager()`
#### 3. Load tileset(s)
`tileset_manager.load(<path>)`
 * **\<path\>** - path to the folder containing the tileset(s) to be loaded. **This folder must contain both the tileset image and the config file generated by the Tileset Creator tool**
#### 4. Get tile
`tileset_manager.get_tile(<tileset>, <tile>)`
 * **\<tileset\>** - name of the tileset to load the tile from. This is the same as the tileset image's name
 * **\<tile\>** - name of the tile to load

[//]: # (t)
Entire tileset dictionaries can also be got in a similar way using the `get_tileset` function
